Sweet breezes gently sigh thy name dear <br>
Through all the lands, across the seas <br>
What ever be our destiny <br>

We sing it loudly and very proudly <br>
Within our hearts thy cherished name will ever be. <BR>
Rise to her call, Ye lustly pioneers <br>
Up give her all through gladness and through tears. <BR>
Let the wonder of her fame <br>
Her glorious name re-echo though the years. <br>

We love the ever, and now forever. <BR>
